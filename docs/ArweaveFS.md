# ArweaveFS - Emulating File Systems on Arweave

ArweaveFS is a data model designed to emulate file systems on Arweave.

Due to Arweave's permanent, immutable nature traditional file system operations such as file/folder renaming and moving, and file updates cannot be done by simply updating the on-chain data model. ArweaveFS works around this by defining an append only transaction data model that allows the state of the file system to be constructed on the client.

## Entity Data Model

ArweaveFS defines several entities for storing file system state on Arweave. These entities have their data split between being stored as tags on their transaction or encoded as JSON as the data of their transaction.

Data stored as transaction tags will be defined in the following manner:

```
Example-Tag: "example-data"
```

while data stored as JSON in the transaction will be defined in the following manner:

```
{
    "exampleField": "exampleData"
}
```

Fields suffixed with `?` are optional.

Field enum values are defined in the format "value 1 | value 2".

All transactions that store these entities unencrypted should define a `Content-Type` tag with value `application/json` and an `ArFS` tag with the version of ArFS specification it implements, currently `0.10`.

### Drive

A drive is a logical grouping of folders and files. All folders and files must be part of a drive.

When creating a drive, a corresponding folder should be created as well. This folder will act as the root folder of the drive. This seperation of drive and folder entity concerns enables features such as folder view queries.

```
Drive-Id: <uuid>
Drive-Privacy: <public | private>
Drive-Auth-Mode?: password
Cipher?: AES256-GCM
Entity-Type: drive
Unix-Time: <milliseconds since unix epoch>

{
    "name": "<user defined drive name>",
    "rootFolderId": "<uuid of the drive root folder>"
}
```

### Folder

Folder entities without a parent folder id are the root folder of their corresponding drives.

```
Folder-Id: <uuid>
Drive-Id: <drive uuid>
Parent-Folder-Id?: <parent folder uuid>
Cipher?: AES256-GCM
Entity-Type: folder
Unix-Time: <milliseconds since unix epoch>

{
    "name": "<user defined folder name>"
}
```

### File

File entity transactions should not include the actual file data they represent, instead, the file data should be uploaded as a separate transaction. This allows for file metadata to be updated without requiring the file data to be reuploaded.

```
File-Id: <uuid>
Drive-Id: <drive uuid>
Parent-Folder-Id: <parent folder uuid>
Cipher?: AES256-GCM
Entity-Type: file
Unix-Time: <milliseconds since unix epoch>

{
    "name": "<user defined file name>",
    "size": <computed file size - int>,
    "lastModifiedDate": <timestamp for OS reported time of file's last modified date represented as milliseconds since unix epoch - int>
    "dataTxId": "<transaction id of stored data>"
}
```

## Creating a Drive

To properly create a new drive, two new entities need to be created, a new drive entity and a new folder entity representing the root folder of that drive.

The `name` of the drive and folder entity should be the same. The drive entity's `rootFolderId` should refer to the `Folder-Id` of the root folder entity. The folder entity should not include a `Parent-Folder-Id` tag.

## Updating and Constructing the File System State

To update the file system clients can simply create transactions for the entities they would like to update, making sure to specify the same entity id as the update target. For example, to move a folder to another folder, the client can create a transaction with that same folder entity's fields pointing to a different parent folder.

Clients can then create a timeline of entity write transactions which the client can replay to construct the drive state. This timeline of transactions should be grouped by the block number of each transaction. At every step of the timeline, the client can check if the entity was written by an authorised user. This also conveniently enables the client to surface a trusted entity version history to the user.

The `Unix-Time` defined on each transaction should be reserved for tie-breaking same entity updates in the same block and should not be trusted as the source of truth for entity write ordering. This is unimportant for single owner drives but is crucial for multi-owner drives with updateable permissions (currently undefined in this spec) as a malicious user could fake the `Unix-Time` to modify the drive timeline for other users.

ArweaveFS utilises a bottom-up data model (files refer to parent folder, folders refer their parent folder etc) to avoid race conditions in file system updates. A top-down data model would require the parent model (ie. a folder) to store references to its children. When multiple users update the parent entity with new children, there's no way to do so in a consistent manner as a user's update to the parent model will not be seen by another user until the transaction has been mined.

## Drive Privacy

Drives can store either public or private data, indicated by the `Drive-Privacy` tag on the drive entity.

On every encrypted entity, a `Cipher` tag should be specified. The required public parameters for decrypting the data should also be specified with the parameter's tag name prefixed by `Cipher-*` eg. `Cipher-IV`. If the parameter is byte data it should be encoded as Base64 in the tag.

Additionally, all encrypted transactions should have the `Content-Type` tag `application/octet-stream` as opposed to `application/json`.

Private drives have a global drive key, `D`, and multiple file keys, `F`, for encryption. `D` is used for encrypting the drive and folder metadata whereas `F` is used for encrypting file metadata and the actual stored data. Having these different keys, `D` and `F`, allows a user to share specific files without revealing the contents of their entire drive.

`D` is derived using HKDF-SHA256 with an unsalted RSA-PSS signature of the drive's id and a user provided password. `F` is also derived using HKDF-SHA256 with the drive key and the file's id. A reference implementation is available [here](private_drive_kdf_reference.dart).

## Additional Client Concerns

### Folder/File Paths

ArweaveFS does not store folder or file paths along with entities as these paths will need to be updated whenever the parent folder name changes which can require many updates for deeply nested file systems. Instead, folder/file paths are left for the client to generate from the folder/file names.

### Client Syncing

Drives that have been updated many times can have a long entity timeline which can be a performance bottleneck. To avoid this clients can cache the drive state locally and sync updates to the file system by only querying for entities in blocks higher than the last time they checked.

### Folder View Queries

Clients that want to provide users with a quick view of a single folder can simply query for an entity timeline for a particular folder by its id. Clients with multi-owner permissions will additionally have to query for the folder's parent drive entity for permission based filtering of the timeline.

## Future Work

### Multi-User Dynamic Permissioned Drives

A drive can have a dynamic set of users that are able to write to it. This will take advantage of the entity timeline for filtering of malicious/invalid entities.

This is achievable relatively easily for public drives but is much more complicated for private drives due to the need to share keys asynchronously. An implementation can draw inspiration from the Signal protocol on how to achieve this.
