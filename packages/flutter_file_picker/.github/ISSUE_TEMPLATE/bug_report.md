Before creating an issue, make sure that you are on the latest `file_picker` version and that there aren't already any similar opened inssues. Also, check if it isn't described on the [Wiki](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/wiki), specially on [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/wiki/Troubleshooting) page.

Also, sometimes a simple `flutter clean` and `flutter build` again with latest file_picker version, may end up by fixing cached issues, so I encourage you to first do so.
