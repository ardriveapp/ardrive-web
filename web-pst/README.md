# ArDrive Web PST

This folder is where the ArDrive PST contract access code is stored. The code here is built using Rollup to take advantage of tree-shaking and used by the Flutter app on the web for tipping ArDrive PST holders.

To build the script, run:

```
npm run build
```

The result will be available unuglified at `web-pst/dist/pst.js` and uglified at `web/pst.min.js`.
