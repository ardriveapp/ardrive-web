Git Usage
- use the following prefixes for commit messages followed by a colon and a space:
  - "fix" for bug fixes
  - "feat" for new features
  - "perf" for performance improvements
  - "docs" for documentation changes
  - "style" for formatting changes
  - "refactor" for code refactoring
  - "test" for adding missing tests
  - "chore" for chore tasks
- when determining the commit message prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above
- use lower case for commit messages
- the commit message should also include a list of the changes made in the commit after the summary line if the changes are not self explanatory

- `fix:` for bug fixes

- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
